<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<body>
    <p>This website provides references to my publicly-available professional work. Why the simple design?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Accessible:</b> Not everyone has high-speed nbn or 5G internet. You won't find clunky images, videos, or
            advertisements here. This site is also mobile-friendly.</li>
        <li><b>Nostalgic:</b> I wanted to capture the charm of the early 2000s internet, evoking fond memories of
            simpler times
            that many people inlcuding myself
            cherish.</li>
        <li><b>Detox:</b> In contrast to todayâ€™s dopamine-driven websites, the simple design encourages your brain to
            slow
            down, offering a refreshing experience that helps reduce the noise and distractions of the
            modern internet.</li>
    </ul>
