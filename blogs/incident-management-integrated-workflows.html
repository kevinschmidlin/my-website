        <h2>From Whiteboards to Integrated Workflows: A Modern Journey in Incident Management</h2>
        <p><small>05 May 2025 â€¢ 4 min read</small></p>
        <p>
        <h3>humble beginings</h3>
        In the early days of security operations, incident response revolved around a single room, a
        whiteboard, and a handful of analysts who could shout updates across a desk. Evidence lived on network
        shares, timelines were scribbled with dry-erase pens, and coordination was effortlessâ€”until teams began
        working across time zones. Suddenly hand-offs spanned across regions, leadership expected real-time updates,
        and a process once designed for a pirate crew buckled under a grand line.

        <h3>one small step for man</h3>
        The first attempt to digitise the war-room came in the form of a proprietary incident-response solution. On
        paper it seemed ideal: secure, with built-in case management and a incident wizard? ðŸ§™ In practice, however,
        three
        problems
        emerged. Licensing was sold per user, so only the core responders could log in; everyone else waited for
        status emails. Integration with the SIEM and threat-intelligence feeds was nonexistent, forcing analysts to
        copy
        IOCs by hand. And worst of all, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vfbVVkwdQw&t=255s"
            target="_blank">crappy user interface</a>
        turned a promised
        "easy-to-use platform" into a single point of frustration. The
        tool survived, but only as a repository for post-incident documentation.

        Frustration with the proprietary solution led the team to an open-source counterpart. Because it was
        licence-free, every responderâ€”and every stakeholderâ€”could collaborate in the same space. The platform
        shipped with connectors that enriched artefacts automatically, so as soon as a hash or domain landed in the
        case, additional context appeared in seconds. Chat-ops integration meant that the conversation around the
        incident, complete with time stamps and threaded actions, was preserved as evidence. A cryptographic vault
        hashed every upload, providing immutability and defensible chain-of-custody. The honeymoon period, however,
        revealed two familiar truths about open source: bugs arrive unannounced, and expertise can bottleneck around
        a single engineer. Report generators defaulted to the wrong language, on-premise deployment limited the use
        of cloud extensions, and when the resident SME took leave, maintenance became backlog.

        <h3>one giant leap for mainkind</h3>
        With operational maturity rising, leadership began asking for a platform that could handle incident
        response under one umbrellaâ€”supported by a someone that
        answers the phone at three a.m. The natural next step was an enterprise solution equipped
        with a major-incident module. Because it shares data with the broader department, security incidents could
        automatically inherit asset information, maintenance windows, and custodian details. Robust APIs could allow
        alerts from the SIEM to open tickets instantly, while chat integrations preserve the conversational timeline
        without manual exports.

        <h3>lessons learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Plan for growth</strong>, not the current headcount.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritise integration</strong>, or risk losing time and context.</li>
            <li><strong>Treat chats as evidence</strong>, with export and retention plans.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>closing thoughts</h3>
        Incident management is not a destination but an operating rhythm. The evolution from dry-erase scribbles to
        an open-source workhorse and, soon, to an integrated enterprise suite shows that tools matter, yet
        adaptability matters more. The wisest advice from the journey is deceptively simple: choose the platform
        that makes the right action the easiest action, and keep your playbooks portableâ€”you will need them when the
        next solution comes along.
